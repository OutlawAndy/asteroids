asteroids
=========

An ongoing experiment in canvas and javascript games

Movement calculation code is based on David Griffith's [animatic](https://code.google.com/p/animatic/) library.

The game can be played from the [GitHub Page](http://outlawandy.github.io/asteroids/) for this repository.

Very basic controls:

`spacebar` to shoot
`arrow keys` to move;  `up` to accelerate, `down` to decelerate, `left` to veer left, and `right` to veer right.
It defaults to `25` asteroids per game, but you can change that with a query parameter. e.g. `?rocks=100`

Hope you enjoy!
