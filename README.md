asteroids
=========

An ongoing experiment in canvas and javascript games

Movement calculation code is based on David Griffith's [animatic](https://code.google.com/p/animatic/) library.

The game can be played from the [GitHub Page](http://outlawandy.github.io/asteroids/) for this repository.

in game controls:
- `spacebar` or `f` to shoot
- `↑`&`↓` or `j`&`k` to accelerate/decelerate
- `←`&`→` or `h`&`l` to steer
- `m` to toggle the music
- `q` to quit

Games defaults to `25` asteroids, but you can change that with a query parameter. e.g. `?rocks=100`

Hope you enjoy!
